Subject: [PATCH 0/3 v2] fs: allow to use dirfd as root for openat and other *at syscalls

The problem is that a pathname can contain absolute symlinks and now
they are resolved relative to the current root.

It may be a problem if you want to open a file in another namespace.
For example, you open /proc/PID/root for a process from the target
namespace and then you use openat() to open a file from this namespace.

If a path to the file contains an absolute symlink, you will open a file
from the current namespace, because a symlink will be resolved relative
to the current root.

A proposed solution adds a new flag which means that dirfd should be
set as a root for a current system call (openat(), statat(), etc).

Here are examples how we can open a file in a contex of another process.

How we can do this without these changes:

	old_root = open("/", O_PATH);
	old_cwd = open(".", O_PATH);
	chroot("/proc/PID/root");

	fd = open(pathname, O_RDONLY);

	fchdir(old_root); /* emulate fchroot() */
	chroot(".");
	fchdir(old_cwd);

	close(old_cwd);
	close(old_root);

How this code is simplified with new flags:
	dirfd = open("/proc/PID/root", O_PATH);
	fd = open(dirfd, pathname, O_RDONLY | O_ATROOT);
	close(dirfd);

One more thing is that chroot isn't available for unprivileged users.

We met this problem, when we tryed to dump an ubuntu container and
failed to resolve /proc/PID/root/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, because
/var/run was a symlink to /run.

Changes since the first version:
- change a value of O_ATROOT to not intersect with other constants.
